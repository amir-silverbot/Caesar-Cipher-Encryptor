# Caesar Cipher Encryption Tool
It's a python3 tool that encrypts your password or data with Caesar cipher method.

Caesar cipher is an encryption protocol that encrypts data with a fixed algorithm.
The algorithm is too simple so **don't use it to encrypt important files!**
## How to use?
1. Open Terminal.
2. Run the program with an interpreter.
```bash
$ python3 caesar-cipher-tool.py
```
3. You'll be asked for a string.
4. Then you'll be asked for the shift
5. At last the program will give you the output!

***happy hacking :)***
